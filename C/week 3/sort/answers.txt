sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: after repeating the algorithm a few time , I observed that big O is way greater-than omega,
                  example O = 0m6.040s and omaga = 0m0.732s

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: after repeating the algorithm a few time , I observed that big O = omega,
                  and big O was way lower in comparison to hte other sort,
                  example O = 0m0.848s and omaga = 0m0.877s

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: after repeating the algorithm a few time , I observed that big O = omega, but less then sort 2,
                  example O = 0m2.782s omaga = 0m3.144s
